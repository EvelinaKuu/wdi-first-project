### Technologies used

To create this project I used the following technologies:

- HTML5
- SCSS
- Javascript (ECMAScript 6)
- jQuery
- Atom
- GIMP
- Git
- Github
- Heroku

### The Approach taken

I started with wireframes to plan my project and went into detail in planning all the steps. As Learn nouns is an educational game I would keep in my during the planning that everything should support the users learning process.


### Challenges Faced

In terms of coding my biggest challenge was the random function also the layout and styling in CSS was a big challenge.

### Where next?

In the future I would:

- Add levels and languages:
  *  At the moment the game has Spanish, Finnish, Swedish and Norwegian, each with 10 levels and 10 sentences to translate. I also added a random function which will randomly select a sentence of any of the languages ten times. For the purpose of learning more nouns and words in one language levels should be added. Also it would be beneficial to add a feature to explain the words, so when you move up a level, you would not only know the right option and it's meaning but the other's as well.

- Improve the code:
  * The code could be dryer and also the CSS stylesheet probably have some overlaping styling that are unnecessary.
